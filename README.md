## Purpose
The intention of this project is to learn the Rust programming language by porting existing open-source code based on the IFC Standard.

At the time of writing (20th of Oct 2022) there are no github projects written in Rust with the keywords "ifc". 

I encourage anyone interested in contributing to the project to make contact.
